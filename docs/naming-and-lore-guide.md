# 🪄 Naming & Lore Guide
*A style guide for species names, creature descriptions, and world flavor in the Department of Peculiar Creatures.*

This document establishes the tone, structure, and creative rules used to name species and write lore throughout the project. It ensures new additions remain consistent with the world’s established voice.

# 🎨 World Aesthetic

Creatures in this world are whimsical, peculiar, magical-but-grounded beings. They feel more like:
- woodland spirits,
- strange natural phenomena,
- soft little critters with quirks,
- or uncanny-but-charming companions,

…rather than high fantasy monsters or sci-fi aliens.

The tone is:
- gentle oddity
- cozy magic
- natural folklore
- slightly feral whimsy
- lightly mischievous

Names should feel like they could exist in a storybook or a forest where magic has quietly gone a little weird.

# 🐾 Naming Rules

Species names across the project follow **organic, readable English-adjacent patterns**, rather than invented languages.

- **Gleeble**
- **Moon-Pip**
- **Thornbellow**
- **Sootling**
- **Eye-Sprite**
- **Hearthmare**
- **Wandergrub**
- **Lanternback**
- **Marrowfin**
- **FrostNib**
- **Star-Moth**

---

## 1. Compound Names

Many species combine two simple idea-words into a single name:

Examples:
- **Lanternback** (light + anatomy)
- **Wandergrub** (behavior + creature form)
- **Marrowfin** (body material + anatomy)
- **Thornbellow** (environment + sound)

These compounds should be intuitive and evocative.

---

## 2. Hyphenated Forms

Some names use a hyphen to emphasize their two-part nature:

Examples:
- **Moon-Pip**
- **Star-Moth**
- **Eye-Sprite**

Hyphens are used when:
- the two words each convey a clear meaning
- the rhythm feels better split
- the species name benefits from a little flair

Use sparingly—most names still work without one.

---

## 3. Descriptor + Creature Form Pattern

The most consistent pattern is:

`[Descriptor] + [Creature Word]`

Descriptor examples:
- Moss
- Soot
- Glow
- Drift
- Cinder
- Hollow
- Shimmer
- Pebble
- Frost
- Thorn
- Echo

Creature-form examples:
- Pip
- Nib
- Grub
- Moth
- Sprite
- Back
- Fin
- Sprout
- Tuft
- Wisp
- Gnat

These combinations feel folk-magical and grounded in nature.

---

## 4. Dramatic or “Large Species” Naming

Some creatures sound more imposing:

- **Hearthmare**
- **Gloomhound**
- **Thorn-Stag**
- **Mire-Treader**

These typically follow:

`[Environment] + [Large Animal/Entity]`

And maintain the same grounded, naturalistic tone.

---

## 5. Rarity & Flavor Add-ons (Optional)

Occasionally, species might include a flavor tag—not as a formal taxonomy, but as folklore:

- *Star-Touched*
- *Burrow-Born*
- *The Lesser*
- *Of the Hollow*

Use extremely sparingly to avoid diluting the core naming style.

# 🌒 Lore Style Guidelines

Lore in this world is short, evocative, and reads like a note from an in-world researcher who is both enchanted and slightly confused by these creatures.

### Tone Guidelines
- Magical but not grandiose
- Whimsical but not silly
- Naturalistic but with subtle supernatural twists
- Comfortably eerie at times
- Written with warmth and curiosity

### Length
Most lore is **1–3 sentences**.

### Format
A lore line should ideally:
1. Describe the creature’s appearance or physical quirk
2. Mention its behavior or temperament
3. Offer a small magical or folkloric detail

Example formats:

> "Gentle creatures with soft ember-lit bodies that appear to lonely travelers. Hearthmares leave warm ash hoofprints believed to calm bad dreams."

> "Small soot-spirits that nest in warm spaces and leave smudges wherever they sleep. Sootlings are mischievous but affectionate once tamed."

> "Drift-Backs are quiet, wind-marked creatures whose swirling patterned shells leave soft trails in the air as they move."
